# Feminist Critiques of Data and Visualization

## Seeing the Rhetoricity of Data, Databases, and Visualizations through Feminism

Rhetoric and writing scholars have not been the only scholars to emphasize the rhetoricity of data and the ways in which data and visualization structure knowledge. Feminist and critical technology scholars (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2016; Frost, 2016; Haraway, 1988; Hill, Kennedy & Gerrard, 2016; Leurs, 2017; Petersen & Walters, 2018; Tufekci & Wilson, 2012) argue against the presumed objectivity and neutral quality of data, pointing out that data is neither objective, nor neutral, but constructed, often many times over, through the process of collection, analysis, and visualization. In Raw Data is An Oxymoron, Lisa Gitelman (2013) points out that “the seemingly indispensable misperception that data are ever raw seems to be one way in which data are forever contextualized — that is, framed —according to a mythology of their own supposed decontextualization” (p. 6-7). This seemingly abstract quality of data is perhaps what allows it to stealthy carry cultural logics and social values, just as preceding symbolic forms of communication have done so. Indeed, Wendy Chun argues that “race and technology impact each other’s logic and development” (p. 8). In some academic and public circles, however, data too often retains its presumptive and lauded freedom from subjectivity, and this, Gitelman observes, along with the “aggregative quality of data helps to lend them their potential power, their rhetorical weight (p. 8).

At a recent VIZ4DH conference workshop, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein (2016) advanced several feminist tenets for visualization and design, including the concept of challenging “claims of objectivity, neutrality and universalism, emphasizing instead how knowledge is always conducted within specific subject positions” (para. 4). For D’Ignazio and Klein, in part, this involves making the rhetorical choices of the researcher/designer and the affordances of the technology explicit, as well as disclosing particular experiences and background factors that may influence these choices. While positionalities are always in flux and have the possibility of transformation (Chaput, 2000; Massumi, 2002), a rhetorical feminist data analysis and visualization methodology can and should incorporate ways of explicitly understanding how positionality constructs data analysis. In her seminal text “Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective,” Donna Haraway (1988) redefines objectivity as a critical perspective and knowledge of how technologies work and work on us: [u]nderstanding how these visual systems work, technically, socially, and psychically, ought to be a way of embodying feminist objectivity” (583). Rather than aspiring towards conventional notions of objectivity, the critical perspective Haraway advocates for is an embodied feminist objectivity that accounts for human and nonhuman decision-making, including the data that make generating visualizations possible. 

Feminist rhetorical research has troubled notions of objectivity by, in part, breaking down the binary structure between categorizations that structure our social and data-driven worlds. In writing studies, communication, and the digital humanities, feminist contributions complicate distinctions between gender categories of Facebook users (Bivens, 2015; Dadas, 2016), notions of public and private (Penney & Dadas, 2016), approaches to distant and close reading (McPherson, 2014), and concepts of vacant and non-vacant housing (Knigge & Cope, 2006). Furthering this structural critique, feminist critiques of binary and other forms of classification point to the importance of understanding the way in which data is structured for analysis. These scholars argue that these taken-for-granted norms in structuring data participate in reifying the kinds of binaries like those mentioned in the work above and participates in a larger history of classification that creates and replicates social hierarchies and power dynamics. D’Ignazio (2017) urges researchers and designers to critically examine our data structuring choices and the choices made for us by APIs and software. Rather than accepting the structure and content of data as it flows through infrastructures to become what we’d term a collection, she emphasizes the need to reflect an awareness that those collections will always be missing data and that existing data is shaped in particular ways. She further argues that these structures and gaps should be acknowledged and perhaps figured into our data analysis and visualization. Although this may indeed prove a less orderly process, Elizabeth Losh, Jacqueline Wernimont, Laura Wexler, and Hong-An Wu (2016) argue in “Putting the Human Back into the Digital Humanities: Feminism, Generosity, and Mess,” that to recognize and address the “human” in digital humanities, 
> [I]t is vital to attend to how corpora composed of supposedly neutral and transparent databases and tools may obscure the many ways that objects of study are positioned in relationship to human—and race, classed, and gendered—constructs of discovery, revelation, display, exhibition, desire, curation, witnessing, and bearing witness it is necessary to evaluate carefully and with discretion the type of datasets that the digital humanities employ. (para. 26).

These authors urge us to interrogate our data sets and formulate an intersectional feminist methodology that de-centers the positivism and rationality that underlies many assumptions of data; instead, they emphasize deeper ways of knowing digital data that make apparent its very human, cultural characteristics. Perhaps most importantly, they attend to how the power hierarchies that structure our social world play a role in structuring our data, data analysis, and digital projects. By doing so, we may end up with methodologies and projects that are far “messier” but that better account for data’s relationship to the human and social world, especially its relationship to power structures.

Although the orderly form of the spreadsheet is nearly indispensable to data analysis and visualization, its rhetorical form and function are masked by the spreadsheet’s tidy appearance. Johanna Drucker (2017) observes that “[s]preadsheets are rhetorically powerful encodings of values and belief whose graphical features participate in their appearance of neutrality – of “unmarkedness” – through the way they graph their relations of power” (p. 909). This power functions through its seemingly neutral organization, which Drucker notes “enacts its power through an effective erasure of the structuring apparatus” (p. 909). Drucker conducts a deep dive into the form and function of visualizations, arguing that visualization operate through established and familiar “conventions for communicating information in graphs, charts, or diagrams make them readily legible. Perhaps, too readily, since the use of these familiar formats often allows them to be consumed without hesitation – or critical consideration” (p. 906-907). Instead of seemingly neutral and passive conventions, she argues that visualizations, and the spreadsheets that underlie them, are created through “authored activities”. Authored activities include processes like the naming of columns and rows, the way items are classified and produced by humans and increasingly by technologies that feed researchers information in established categories that are then replicated in spreadsheet form. Data construction and analysis involve various actors and computational processes at many levels, including the collection and aggregation of this data into quantitative forms meant to identify trends and patterns in a large-scale distant readings of the data. Even interactive visualization, according to Drucker, provides only “[t]he illusion of control or agency, even of authorship” (p. 912). This illusion “is produced by the interaction with the features, the dials, input boxes, and so forth that all speak me as they speak to me. You, they each say, are the one who does this, and not that, or that, and then this and so on” (912). Drucker formulates visualizations as a form of direct address, one in which the visualization interpellates its user into its ideology by its seeming lack of subjective authorship. Following Drucker, the user develops a false sense of agency and control, an illusion predicated on the reality that the interactive possibilities have already been controlled and constrained by the structure and functions of the visualization and underlying data.

Given these critical feminist examinations of data and infrastructure, what are the possibilities of working towards more rhetorically informed data analysis and visualization? Although Klein critiques the distant view involved in data mining, analysis and visualization, she also points out that power inequalities “like sexism or racism, are also problems of scale but they require an increased attention to, rather than a passing over, of the subject positions that are too easily (if at times unwittingly) occluded when taking a distant view” (para. 9). Far from rejecting big data analysis and visualization, Klein argues that “we need to assemble more corpora—more accessible corpora—that perform the work of recovery or resistance” (para. 11). In “What Would Feminist Data Look Like,” Catherine D’Ignazio (2017) advocates for developing ways to design visualizations that talk back to data, partly by finding ways to explicitly include subjectivity and rid visualizations of the God-like perspective Haraway observes. To accomplish this, D’Ignazio further argues for including dissenting perspectives and provides a concrete example through creating visualization labels. She cites a decades old academic-community research and visualization project, [The Detroit Geographic Expedition and Institute)](https://civic.mit.edu/2013/8/7/the-detroit-geographic-expedition-and-institute-a-case-study-in-civic-mapping/) (1971), which creates data visualizations with titles that decidedly reflect a dissenting perspective rather than one of objectivity, like the map entitled, “Where Commuters Run Over Black Children.” Using this example and others, D’Ignazio points out that feminist visualizations would situate data in geographical locations and  bodies. Although positionality has been theorized in its relationship to ethnography, pedagogy, and cultural rhetorics, positionality--identity markers that influence how we construct and understand our world--is far less attended to in relation to digital methodologies, especially around data analysis and visualization. By attending to positionality and incorporating subjectivity into data visualization’s design, we disrupt the presumed neutrality of data and the empirical positivist perspective embedded in much data visualization.

Besides disrupting objectivity and neutrality, feminist methodologies can incorporate rhetorical subjectivity by becoming more attuned to the silences and gaps within scholarship and within one’s individual research archive (Graban, 2013; Lay, 2004; Royster & Kirsch, 2012) and participating in recovering stories of activism. Petersen and Walton (2018) argue that attending to silences and gaps in our research methodologies leaves room to find what is missing in our data, methods, and methodologies: “We previously suggested that filling gaps and silences are an essential goal of feminist research. One way to find these gaps is by using research methods designed to recognize them. For example, feminist content analysis is a way of generating themes from textual data, allowing themes to emerge based on ‘close readings, coding, and memoing’” (p. 427). In this brief quote, Petersen and Walton connect content analysis to the feminist practice of recovering the voices and contributions lost in the silence and gaps of both dominant narratives and computational quantitative analytics. 

Although technical communication and professional writing are often viewed as apolitical and outside the realm of social justice work, in “Apparent Feminism,” Erin Frost (2016) makes the case for a resurgence of feminist-oriented research, which, as she sees it, is especially important due to the public nature of technical communication and the way that such communication is often consumed as value-neutral and objective. For Frost, one way to combat this is through storytelling: “Apparent feminists can take up this call to tell such stories and, thus, insert feminist apparency into the public sphere. The first step in doing so is to pay attention to activists operating in the public sphere” (p. 8). Discussing the transformation of the rhetorical situation from the objective observation of Bitzer’s model to Vatz’s, which Frost reads as more attuned to the role of perception in creating rhetorical interpretation, she states, “Indeed, when considering the urgent need for apparent feminism, we see that the situation is highly rhetorical and that particular kinds of utterances, texts, and rhetorical acts create public biases—or, we might say, crises—which in turn demand an apparent feminist response” (p. 12). Natasha N. Jones, Kristen Moore, and Rebecca Walton (2016) also argue for a closer relationship between technical and professional communication (TPC) and activism: “Although TPC scholars have long been exploring issues of inclusion, the collective contribution of this work has gone largely unnoticed, (over)shadowed by the dominant narrative that technical communication is most concerned with objective, apolitical, acultural practices, theories, and pedagogies” (p. 211-212). 

Endeavoring to offer such a corrective, I’ll apply a feminist rhetorical perspective that asks: 1) When digital tools are employed in this content analysis, how do they affect what’s heard? 2) How can I as a researcher engaged with digital tools be more attuned to tweaking technological affordances to illuminate small data and its comparative value to large quantitative studies? By digging for the small data as well as analyzing large-scale trends and visual information, this webtext will demonstrate how we might push against the affordances of tools that are built to more highly value the insights of large data and amplify easily hidden, though no less important, small data narratives.

I offer the following framework as a way to highlight shared principles and methodological and design suggestions synthesized from the writers represented above, not as a recipe to be followed, but to elucidate some guiding tenets I’ve used and other might find useful as they explore the possibilities and limitations of large data collection, analysis, and visualization. 

## Framework for Feminist Rhetorical Data Visualization Methodology

1. Attend to subjectivity and consider incorporating dissent in the representation of data and conventional features of visualizations. This could manifest in numerous ways, such as through:
- Choices about categories and structuring data
- Labels and naming practices of visualizations
- Including communities in the shape of research and the visualizations produced

2. Attune to silences and gaps and recover what might be missing from the archive or data collection. This might include:
- Locating and emphasizing what’s overlooked by quantitative measures
- Creating visualizations that counter dominant perspectives
- Asking what isn’t reflected in the resulting visualization
- Coding the data using grounded theory to include themes that might be missed using other means of analysis
  

3. Incorporate an awareness of the way in which data and visualizations are “authored” in unseen ways by humans and technologies (Drucker). Ask how we might:
- Augment and challenge existing structures 
- Bring awareness to the way in which data and classification both ignores and creates difference   
- Apply a critical lens to and make apparent the way in which framing and other visualization features create a form of direct address, structure certain kinds of argument, and position viewers as passive receivers of certain kinds of knowledge

4. Create visualizations that put big data in conversation with small data and other ways of knowing. This might be achieved through:
- Situating the data in embodied and geographic contexts (D’Ignazio, Haraway)
- Incorporating other data types like interviews and participant communities
- Using data visualization to tell stories of activism
   
In the following pages, I’ll demonstrate how I’ve attempted to practice this feminist methodology through strategies of rhetorical arrangement and grounded theory that recover stories of activism, value the small data in large collections, and creates multiple visualizations that add poly-vocal nuance instead of the truth value often associated with computational analytics and data analytics.
