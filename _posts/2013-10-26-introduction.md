In recent years, rhetoric and writing studies scholars have begun to engage with large datasets and the technological tools involved in collecting, processing, and visualizing data related to a vast array of social phenomena. Kairos has published work involving big datasets from Laurie Gries (2016) who combines data types, including social media data, to track, largely through data visualization tools, the ongoing circulation and transformation of the Obama Hope image. In another Kairos piece, William I. Wolff (2015) describes his methodology for collecting and examining a large dataset of tweets around a Bruce Springsteen concert to characterize Twitter-based fan writing practices. Jason Palmeri and Ben McCorkle (2017) take a Distant View of English Journal 1912-2012 by using coding schemes and data visualization methods to historicize the disciplinary development of writing studies’ relationship to technology. In each publication, the authors thoughtfully reflect on the constraints and limitations of their studies, particularly highlighting the ways in which their choices in data collection, processing, and visualization have shaped their findings. 

Studies like these acknowledge the influence of “the interplay of material infrastructures, users and texts,” and, by doing so, begin to trouble the objective and scientific valence often ascribed to data analysis and visualization, especially when attached to “Big Data” (Leurs, 2017, p. 137). And yet, as rhetoric and writing studies scholars continue to tread into the waters of data and visualization, and the landscape of technological tools and their affordances continue to transform, these technological changes often result in tools that become simultaneously easier to use and more “black boxed.” As such, it becomes increasingly difficult--and important--for digital rhetoric and writing studies scholars to contribute methodological perspectives that illuminate the unseen and provide new possibilities for rhetorically engaging technologies at the level of infrastructure. To contribute to these kinds of methodological engagements, I argue for a rhetorical and feminist methodological approach to social media data analysis and visualization that deepens data viz’s critical possibilities and conclusions, even within hard-coded software, by expanding the possibilities for visualizations and interpretations, rather than narrowing data analysis conclusions to grasp toward a truth value (boyd & Crawford, 2012).

In this webtext, I will share the feminist rhetorical methodology of social media data and visualization I’ve begun to develop as I’ve worked over the past two years to collect and to analyze a large dataset of tweets containing the keyword “gentrification.” Like Laurie Gries’ Tracking Obama Hope project, I’m interested in how writing and visual rhetoric circulates to activate publics and ignite collective actions, but I’m particularly interested in how that circulating visuality impacts the the changing shape and socio-cultural make-up of urban spaces and their communities. I focus my collection on Twitter data because Twitter has proven to be a communication space for marginalized populations to voice dissent and to collectively take action to challenge dominant power structures (Jules, Summers, & Mitchell, 2018, White Paper). Likewise, Leigh Gruwell (2018) observes that rhetoric and writing studies have “embraced social media as both an object of study as well as a methodological tool,” and yet the authors point out that we have not gone far enough to consider how these platforms shape our research (para. 2). In part to answer calls like Gruwell’s, this study engages with Twitter as an entry point into a wider ecology of emergent social media platforms, physical environments, and bodies that leave traces we can follow to better understand the consequences of their ecological relations. Exploration of these interacting entities informs our understanding of activism in the digital age and the way in which networked visuality and communication technologies complicate our understanding of material processes like gentrification, collective activities like activism, and exploration of “ecological relationality as participating in rhetorical practices and their theorization” (Rickert, 2013, p. 3). 

Likewise, analyzing this large social media dataset has been inseparable from processes of data visualization. Because of the enormous size of this collection, I wouldn’t be able sift and count and qualitatively explore this dataset without the technological tools of visualization, or “the reduction and spatial representation of datasets in such a way as to make them more intelligible than in their pre‐visualization, tabular format” (Hepworth, 2017, p. 8). This webtext won’t simply focus on the visualizations I’ve generated, however, but delve into the infrastructural affordances of this process and how a feminist rhetorical perspective might work with and against the possibilities of these technologies. Instead of reifying the scientific veneer of data science, I strive to contribute to the growing body of critical scholarship that offers rhetorical and generative alternatives to data analysis and visualization methods that privilege quantitative reasoning and focus on revealing “newly visible patterns.” In my case, quantification and pattern finding have been a beginning point for formulating subsequent research directions and using both analytical and inventive approaches to study large datasets. Data analysis and visualization are enhanced and complicated by adopting a feminist rhetorical methodology that values qualitative data, multiplicity, and narrative. In using feminist theories, I’m connecting to diverse and varied critical perspectives. This approach “encompasses a range of ideas about how identity is constructed, how power is assigned, and how knowledge is generated, as well as how a range of intersectional forces such as race, class, and ability, combine to influence the experience of being in the world” (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2016, para. 1). This work is also an answer to Johanna Drucker’s (2017) call “to attend to how visualizations do their work if we are to fully understand the work that they do” (p. 913). Such a methodology provides for greater understanding of the way in which such data is shaped and adds nuance to the way in which we work with large datasets to make knowledge and share insight gained through data analysis and visualization. Finding a feminist perspective through data, as I’ll show, results in a methodology that is not just analytical and critical but also generative and inventive.
