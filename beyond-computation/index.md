# Looking Beyond Computational Analysis

## Authoring Analyses and Visualizations: Tableau and 2,000,000 Tweets

Tableau is a "freemium" data analytic software that, though built primarily for professional data analysts in business and nonprofits, provides many affordances for academic research and visualization in the humanities and social sciences (Bruns, 2018; Felt, 2016). After exploring various options that required more programming skills, like the R analysis I discussed above, I began to use Tableau because of its easy-to-use Graphic User Interface (GUI) and drag and drop analytical functionality; however, the visualizations like line charts and bar graphs that Tableau offers provide a pseudo-objective perspective, like Haraway’s conquering gaze from nowhere, in which the greatest quantity of items appear to be most significant.

In Anti-Gentrification Tweets from 2016-2018 (Figure 2), the peaks in retweets seem to suggest that there is important activity occurring in those time periods. Tableau is interactive in the sense that it allows users to explore the granular data underneath the lines by clicking on a point in the chart, clicking on the view data icon, and then clicking on the full data tab. A pop-up box displays the underlying data, in this case the rows of tweets and metadata. Using these features, I was able to sort and export this data for further exploration, providing much smaller, more manageable data subsets that correspond to peaks in user activity around gentrification and, in some cases, illuminate tweets and visuals that have gone viral. By doing this, I was able to see which tweets in my dataset were most frequently retweeted as well as to match that activity to particular times. By exploring the tweets, I was able to see how users were communicating about and representing gentrification. In the most retweeted tweets, gentrification was most often associated with popular culture events and changes in the built environment that didn’t relate directly to housing but a broader sense of cultural colonization. In many of these popular retweets, gentrification is associated with white dominance over nonwhite others and often takes shape through cultural forms like entertainment or commodities. 

The greatest peak occurs on August 25th, with most of data showing retweets of the following original tweet text and image:

In the subsequent retweets, mentions, and remixes, users argue that Taylor Swift is “gentrifying” Beyonce’s song “Formation” in her music video for “Look What You Made Me Do.” Subsequent tweets include variations, such as remixed lyrics like, “I got ketchup in my bag, swag” and “I see it, I want it, I steal it so I’ll own it.” Not only do users participate in creating arguments about gentrification through visual and textual remix, users also argue about whether a term like “gentrification” can be applied to music and music videos.

{% include lightbox.html class="feature-img" src="/images/tweet_conversation.png" data="group" title="Conversation about Taylor Swift Gentrification Tweet" width="500px" height="auto" caption="Image 2: Conversation about Taylor Swift Gentrification Tweet" %}

The date of this tweet happens to be important, since this activity followed the Video Music Awards and users were involved in the popular Twitter practice of live tweeting an event. In their study of Occupy Wall Street through Twitter, Joel Penney and Caroline Dadas (2014) observe that the:

> [S]haring functions essential to the design of contemporary social media platforms (such as the retweeting feature on Twitter) allow movement members who are not present at face-to-face actions to participate in the circulation of texts and thus take on active roles in the shaping of a critical counterpublic. (p. 16)

Although most users whose tweets were collected as a part of my two-year study of anti-gentrification rhetoric on Twitter were not participating in organized protest like the OWS protesters in the Penney and Dadas’ study, the authors’ observations that Twitter’s design affordances allow users who might be widely separated in geographical area to “participate in the circulation of texts” and by doing so actively shape a critical counterpublic. Indeed, the Swift Formation meme didn’t only circulate on Twitter. Publications from the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article169455027.html) to the [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-beyonce-formation-video_us_59a05b6fe4b05710aa5bf5f5) subsequently reported on the Twitter conversation around the Swift Formation meme gentrification debate. These reports remarked on how Twitter users’ identified and communicated about Swift’s use of aesthetic visual styles and lyrical content that were similar to Beyonce’s “Formation.” This reporting is an important element of “metaculture.” Laurie Gries (2015) urges visual rhetoric researchers to also collect and analyze the “metaculture” around pieces of visual culture. Gries goes on to state “[t]hat the pace at which culture changes is driven by motion generated between the circulation of metaculture or ideas and interpretations about culture, and that thing it comments upon” (p. 126). Following Gries, visual rhetoric like the Swift Formation meme and the metaculture around it could indicate processes of cultural change, perhaps extending the meaning of gentrification from a strictly spatial process to one of cultural homogenization, appropriation, and commodification. Gries states that this is especially possible if this visual rhetoric is followed by “the production of other actualized versions with the same image or derivatives that may resemble it in form, genre, style, content, or function” (p. 122). In many ways, these repeated images and/or derivatives are characteristic of both the meme genre and the functional design of retweeting.

## Subjectivity and Dissent in Gentrification Tweets 2016-2018

Perhaps examining individual tweets and visual rhetoric like the Swift Gentrification meme are richer ways of knowing this data than the Tableau graphs and charts; however, because it’s not feasible to human-read a collection of nearly two-million tweets, data visualization is a necessary part of working with this data, and it can be a productive way to locate data for further study. Tableau’s many different graphs, charts, and map visualizations, as Drucker points out, are “formats [that] are effective, efficient, and surprisingly obfuscating” (p. 907). By “obfuscating,” Drucker is referring to the way in which these visualization conventions seem to be objectively relaying neutral information: “nowhere is there a single overt marking that indicates the image is a mode of address, a structuring instrument rhetorically engaged in productions of power” (p. 907). Even when the audience of the visualization is the researcher, as in my case, it’s important to be aware of how the visualization directs one’s focus to read the most quantitatively visible tweets as the most significant.

{% include lightbox.html class="page-img-right" src="/images/cider_graffiti.png" data="group" title="Hipster hard cider tweet" width="500px" height="auto" %}


It would be easy simply not to see tweets that appear only once, or users whose tweets aren’t retweeted in viral proportions. Because Tableau allows users to click on any point in the line and explore the underlying data, data which often contains more than just the most frequent posts, conceivably, a researcher could pick out tweets that weren’t the most frequent. This would have to be a conscious methodological decision since the visualization functions by graphically orienting the gaze to the quantitatively greatest data items. Furthermore, Tableau visualizations are all different shades of quantitative measurement of attributes, like dates that correspond with tweet activity, users who tweet the most, and those whose tweets are most retweeted. In order to reorient our gaze from the greatest to what might be hidden beneath the most frequently occurring aspects of our dataset, we can push against data analytic and visualization software to find the small data that might otherwise go unseen.

These computational ways of exploring the large dataset provide a way for understanding how ad-hoc anti-gentrification rhetors communicate about gentrification, particularly in how gentrification is associated with white cultural domination, appropriation, and commodification of nonwhite culture and spaces; however, Tableau doesn’t illuminate any of the tweets made by more organized anti-gentrification groups. 

{% include lightbox.html class="page-img-left" src="/images/15_dollar_40.png" data="group" width="500px" height="auto" title="$15 40 ounce tweet" %}

I knew such groups existed in the dataset, partly through my initial R frequency analysis of bigrams, but also through human reading portions of the dataset spreadsheet. To make Tableau see these smaller groups, who, because they act more locally and outside of the realm of celebrity and entertainment, are not retweeted to the extent that memes about Taylor Swift or fifteen dollar 40s are, I separated all tweets that contained “Boyle Heights,” a frequently mentioned location in the R analysis. I used these tweets to create a separate database and conducted additional research to provide a smaller-scale partial view of anti-gentrification rhetoric that also strives to situate and contextualize data in bodies and geographical spaces.
