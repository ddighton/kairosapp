## Listening for the Silences & Gaps: Locating DBH in 2,000,000 Tweets

Why should we look for and study tweets that don’t go viral or even circulate widely? Indeed, studying viral tweets and hashtags is the dominant trend in rhetoric and writing studies as well as in other disciplines. While there are benefits to these kinds of studies, virality, especially in hashtag activism is often, though not always, viewed as less impactful and significant than embodied protest. While twitter-based movements like #metoo, #blacklivesmatter, and the use of the social media during the Arab Spring uprisings certainly give credence to the idea that activism involving Twitter helps to impact change in the offline world, what is the significance of social-media aided activism that doesn’t go viral or widely circulate? How does studying these communications provide rhetoric and writing studies with a more nuanced understanding of “rhetoric as it happens” in virtual and embodied spaces? How does the way that we work with visualizations change as we attempt to analyze and trace the movement of rhetoric through situated and embodied locations and through digital media? 

To explore these questions, I compiled a new dataset based of the Boyle Heights spreadsheet I’d begun to create from the larger dataset. I also went back to Twitter and collected all the tweets Twitter’s API would allow me to collect on Defend Boyle Heights (DBH). DBH is a Los Angeles activist group that has garnered considerable media attention from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times to Newsweek, as well as network television news from CBS to Fox. In most reporting, it’s clear DBH commands local and national attention largely due to what’s usually described as “militancy” and “outspoken tactics.” I first became aware of them through locating a video in the data collection, which shows one of their early protests of PSSST Gallery moving into the Anderson Row Warehouse District of Boyle Heights, LA. On May 14th, 2016, members of Defend Boyle heights and other coalition members against artwashing and gentrification in Boyle Heights assembled in front of PSSST art gallery. The group projected a series of images outside the wall of PSSST: a rose blooming, money falling from the sky, and then a screenprint style figure with the words PISS on PSST. In front of the gallery, protesters chant, “El pueblo unido jamás será vencido!”. In English: “The people united will never be defeated.” This video is a good example of the way in which DBH targets incoming businesses and nonprofits like art galleries as a gentrifying force in their 94% Latinx neighborhood. 

DBH coalesced as an activist group and created several public social media accounts in early 2016. They created their Twitter profile in April 2016, shortly after I began collecting tweets. In their Twitter profile, they describe themselves as “an autonomous coalition committed to building community power against gentrification principally through direct action. Their Twitter profile (1578 followers) links to a blog, and they frequently post to Twitter by also linking to Facebook (9322 likes and followers) and Instagram (7898 followers). Additional DBH blog posts include a rough history of the group, including traditional documents associated with activist groups like mission statements, reports, principles of solidarity, and an explanation of their tacts. To create a collection around DBH, I gathered metaculture like news articles, journal articles and book excerpts on DBH and Boyle Heights’ long Chicanx activist history, especially those that focus on its importance to the Chicano Movement and mural art movement. Since Facebook and Instagram APIs are pretty much closed to researchers, I manually gathered posts from these other social media accounts. To understand their communication practices as a way to also, I hoped, understand the way in which DBH’s embodied and digital energy shaped the space of Boyle Heights, I collected all their tweets.

Initially, I tried the same Tableau techniques I’d used with the large dataset on the 1000 DBH tweet collection. By doing so, I was able to examine key moments in their history through peaks of activity. For instance, In DBH Tweets from 2016-2018 (Figure 3), it’s clear that DBH became much more active on Twitter during their second year. The peaks of activity don’t reveal viral tweets or repeated content about a few single tweets in the way that the Tableau charts did for the large dataset. Since DBH is the author of all of the tweets, even if retweeting others, Tableau graphs are less useful in understanding tweets by an individual user.

<figcaption>Figure 4: DBH Hashtags: Indexing Gentrification's Oppression</figcaption>

The chart Secondary Hashtags (Figure 4) provides a way to understand the issues DBH connects with their overall purpose of opposing gentrification as well as key locations and targeted direct actions while also mapping them onto time periods by month. Rolling the cursor over October 2018 highlights issues like solidarity, rent control, housing is a human right, etc, that DBH chose to connect and index their tweets to by using a hashtag naming that issue (Image 3).

## Dissenting from Analytics: Locating DBH in Situated Geographies

These line graphs, charts, and maps, although useful for gleaning an overview of the group’s Twitter activity, central themes of concern, and geographic reach, also produce a disembodied, neutral, and quantitatively valued perspective isn’t adequate to visualize the nuance and impact with which DBH is acted upon and acts within their neighborhood. In an effort to ground Tweets in more specific locations and embodied actions, I used grounded theory to create a coding structure. Cresswell (2014) describes grounded theory as a “design of inquiry” whereby “a researcher derives a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the views of participants” (p. 14). In the case of this study, I understood DBH’s perspective to be limited to the expression of their tweets. The process I followed “involves using multiple stages of data collection and the refinement and interrelationship of categories of information” (p. 14). For me, these stages included reading and rereading all of DBH’s tweets and also examining every piece of attached media. Initially, my coding scheme involved identifying over twenty actions. This coding was already a way of condensing particular actions into a more general term, but because I wanted to visualize this information in a way that was usable and clear, I reduced the action codes down to three overall types: communication practices, direct actions, and legal actions. I retained the more granular code, categories like celebration, mobilizing, surveilling, fundraising, art intervention, etc., in a way that would still appear in the visualization, but would not be one of the interactive features that control the points on the map. I created another spreadsheet column to code for the targets of these actions and again went through a process of condensing over twenty different codes down six broader categories: art, business, community building, entertainment, government forces, and housing. I then coded each tweet, looking both at the visual media and the text of the tweet.

Coding is far from a cut and dry process. Partly due to the time and labor required to manually read and code each tweet and the needs of the visualization convention to keep it simple, clear, and easy to use, I chose to apply only one primary action and theme code to each tweet. Although many tweets contain explicit or implicit language and media that might tie to another code, at least in this first iterative phase, I coded for what I determined was the primary subject of the tweet, the primary action (sometimes this resulted in two codes since both seemed to be equally emphasized), and I identified any location information in the tweet or media. As previously mentioned, tweets weren’t often geolocated, but in the case of DBH’s tweets, almost all of them referred to a specific location by providing an address or named entity in the tweet or the attached media. Therefore, in order to determine location, I scoured the tweets and attached media for location information. Although some visual analytics exist, like Google Vision API, few are available for free, and even fewer exist that will analyze a large dataset for free. After experimenting with a few options like Google Vision API, I found that existing computational tools wouldn’t be able to carry out this location coding and perform it with the accuracy of human reading.  In their tweets, many locations are names of businesses that I could only identify because of my familiarity with DBH. For instance, a tweet might mention “la bbq”, without indicating that it’s the name of an art gallery or providing any recognizable street address or entity. Additionally, much of this info was contained in photos or videos that I viewed to locate building names or cross streets. This process of reading and viewing and rereading and viewing to code each tweet for location, action, and theme probably took 100 hours, and it’s by no means scientific; however, the additional codes provide a way to understand gentrification through grounding this understanding in DBH’s tweet perspective and geographic location.

After adding these three rows to the spreadsheet of DBH’s tweets, I first used used Carto to map all of the locations I’d coded in my close reading process. The resulting map, Figure 5, demonstrates DBH’s reach as well as the time-lapse of this activity. I also used Carto to map DBH’s collective actions in connection with the locations of the gentrifying forces as identified by DBH through their tweets. The resulting visualization (Figure 6) attempts to visualize DBH’s circulation and impact on the neighborhood of Boyle Heights by identifying direct actions, communication practices, and legal actions.

<figcaption>Figure 6: DefendBoyleHts actions map</figcaption>

These actions and practices are tied to themes that represent the gentrifying force they’ve identified and targeted or a method by which they’ve communicated to express beliefs or build alliances and community.

By using the zoom feature, the focus of the map will narrow to the neighborhood bounds of Boyle Heights, which over the years has been divided by other historical urban developments, like six highways, including two major interstates. This view shows just how close Boyle Heights, with [average household incomes at $33,235](http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/income/median/neighborhood/list/), is to greater [Los Angeles](https://la.curbed.com/2018/8/20/17760048/los-angeles-most-expensive-neighborhoods), an area with some of the highest real estate prices and income levels in the country. The blue dots between the LA River and Highway 101 in Boyle Heights show the art galleries DBH identifies and protests, including PSSST, the gallery from the previously mentioned video. Although the dots aren’t adequate to represent the level of embodied and digital attention focused in particular actions, each is tied to a Google street view image of the location, giving viewers a sense of the space, and labeled with an actions such as protest, march, or art intervention.

<figcaption>Figure 7: DefendBoyleHts action themes map</figcaption>

Figure 7 allows users to explore the dataset location by the themes such as art, business, and community building. Layers can be toggled on and off to provide an understanding of where certain themes occur in the space of Boyle Heights. 

These custom maps are in the early inventive phases, and although I have plans for adding additional visual elements like symbology and more visual texture, I haven’t yet found a way to completely depart from the omniscient perspective maps afford; however, by coding and mapping from the perspective of DBH’s tweets, the view of Boyle Heights is one that surveils incoming gentrifying forces and illuminates the tactics DBH has used to oppose these forces. This map doesn’t yet reflect the galleries and businesses that have closed, at least to some degree because of DBH’s attention; however, their tweets are a record of a community that has waged a two-year-and-counting battle to retain the Latinx character of their neighborhood and protect existing residents from displacement. From one of their earliest victories with the closing of PSSST to the recent gallery closing of 365 Mission, future iterations of this map will further attempt to trace the consequentiality of DBH as a vitality that stretches beyond the moment of its tweets to what Gries (2015) describes as the “consequences [that] emerge before, during, and after a thing’s initial physical production and delivery” (p. 87).

Organizing tweets by distinct categories required by spreadsheets and most visualizations necessitates delineation that elides the ways in which categories of themes and actions bleed together. Everything I’ve coded could be labeled a communication practice since each one corresponds to a tweet. Similarly, some art interventions leaned more towards communication practices, like handmade zines and eviction maps, while others like graffitti and splashed paint outside galleries might be considered more akin to direct actions. In future iterations of this map, I hope to better represent this nuance. In addition to the struggle over distinct categorization, some actions and practices are combined under broader umbrella terms. As I noted previously, this broader categorization achieves a greater level of usability and clarity, but it loses meaningful distinction. For instance, “government forces” includes those posts that reference policing, Immigration or Custom Enforcement (ICE), and transportation, as well as white supremacy, imperialism, and patriarchy.  To limit the number of categories and the visual attention required to understand the map, I combined these terms under the category “government forces,” since each subcategory relates in some way to state power structures. This is just a brief discussion of many of the ways in which I chose to structure the data based on the demands of spreadsheet structures that visualizations rely upon as well as the concepts that we hold about what makes a clear and usable visualization. The resulting visualization is far from an ideal representation of this data, in no small part because it reduces visually rich and emotion-laden interactions to points, symbols which only communicate a fraction of the depth and nuance of the rhetorical action and doubtlessly even less so of the embodied moment. Despite these drawbacks, these DBH maps come closer to situating data in embodied, geographical situations and by mapping from DBH’s tweet perspective, the map surveils urban change from the perspective of the existing residents rather than those dominant narratives circulated through master plans and tourism strategies created by city elites.
