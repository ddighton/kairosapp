The inventive aspect of digital methodology has long been considered a valuable part of digital pedagogy, but has been less theorized as form of inventive research. In Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice, Eyman (2015) laid the groundwork for a generative approach to visualization, stating, “it is not simply a tool for displaying the results of analytic methods; it is itself a method that can be used to structure data in ways that reveal patterns--in other words, it is an analytic technique in its own right (110). Eyman theorizes visualization tools as actors that play a role in structuring data, influencing the visual that is produced, and at least partially shaping the meaning that’s made from it. Equally important, he points out that these technologies are not just tools, but “analytic techniques,” a phrase that implies their uses aren’t solely for a singular public-facing outcome, but part of a varied and plural approach to visualization as research process as well as product. Perhaps going a step further, Laurie Gries (2017) emphasizes incorporating playfulness and experimentation into digital data methodology, also noting a shift to more digitally-engaged projects in rhetoric and writing studies: “As we begin to work with larger data sets and play with visualization as a research strategy, however, we cannot let the unknown prevent us from experimentation” (Intro, “Mapping Obama Hope: A Data Visualization Project for Visual Rhetorics,” para. 9). Scholarship like this makes considerable progress towards digital data and visualization techniques that trouble the scientific paradigms of data analysis and visualization that aspire towards distant, objective perspectives and quantitative measurements that reduce complex information down to neat categories and characteristics and visualizations that force us to take what Donna Haraway called the “conquering gaze from nowhere” (581).

When theorizing the digital, arrangement can be difficult to locate beneath the  architectural layers of data analytic software, but arrangement is one of the “conditions of possibility for the kind of pattern and relationship analysis carried out under the umbrella of data mining” (Brooke, qtd. in Eyman 2015, n.p.). As Brooke stretches arrangement beyond the discursive to include digital pattern finding, so arrangement also includes “manipulating digital media as well as selecting ready-made works and reconstituting them into new works; remixing” (Eyman, 2015, n.p.). As Aaron Beveridge (2017) points out, data visualization is always rhetorical, often on many levels, some computational and/or non-human. I argue for a rhetorical and feminist methodological approach to data analysis and visualization that deepens data viz’s critical possibilities and conclusions, even within hard-coded software, to expand the possibilities for visualizations and interpretations, rather than narrowing data analysis conclusions to grasp toward a truth value (boyd, 2013). 

In Lingua Fracta, Collin Brooke (2009) confronts Lev Manovich’s claim that “database and narrative are natural enemies” (Manovich, quoted in Brook, p. 97). In Brooke’s reading of Manovich, this binary relationship comes down to the sequential organization of narrative: a narrative is structured by a sequence of unfolding events and the subsequent actions of characters. Because a database doesn’t adopt a sequential structure, a sense of time passing through lived experience, this happens and then this happens, in Manovich’s view, it cannot be a narrative. A database, of course, is structured in rows and columns and populated by individual items and modes of analysis often involve counting seeming equally weighted individual datums. By focusing on sequential order, Brooke argues that Manovich is missing a key reconfiguring of the canon of arrangement in the digital age: instead of sequential organization of events that represent time progressing, in digital media, arrangement is rhetorically configured by the user’s or researcher’s practice, both the choices and the tools s/he employs. Brooke further elaborates: “building a database of related items allows patterns and relationships to emerge” (p. 107). It is pattern, rather than sequence that defines arrangement in the database structure that allows for many digital media expressions. Although writing nearly ten years ago and before our present “big data” era, Brooke’s emphasis on pattern finding is equally relevant today. It’s impossible, or at least highly inefficient, to read big data, or large datasets, a term I prefer because I’m not combining multiple large datasets with the goal of running algorithmic calculations to make a prediction. A large dataset, in my case, is derived from one data source, Twitter; however, this doesn’t make it any easier to read, partly due to the quantity and partly due to the structure of the data as it travels from Twitter’s Application Programming Interface (API) to a server, which I view through my desktop interface. Large datasets necessitate computational modes of reading--analytics and visualizations--processes that rope in other software structures and logics before they generate something easily read by human eyes, a bar chart or line graph, for instance. These visualizations often begin by transforming data into an orderly spreadsheet or database form, so that the subsequent software applications can, indeed, read the data in way that will generate an analytical and often visual result. In dissecting Manovich’s claim that “database and narrative are natural enemies,” Brooke does not quite make the point that these patterns and relationships can be understood as narratives, and narratives, as Walter Fisher (1984) elucidated are “public, moral arguments” (12). Indeed, in the digital era, academic programs and corporate jobs are increasingly created around “data storytelling.” Forbes argues that data storytelling skills and literacies are increasingly valuable in and that “data storytelling is a structured approach for communicating data insights, and it involves a combination of three key elements: data, visuals, and narrative” (para. 4). Although often the data storytelling model is geared towards the interests of business--the data is compiled and analyzed to increase a company’s reach and profits and limit its vulnerabilities losses--data storytelling can be a means by which rhetoric, writing studies, and technical communication expand our respective research and pedagogical practices in a way that also reflects and enriches broader understandings of data visualization, particularly its constructed and rhetorical qualities. Do we understand the always partial and selective vision that is created by quantification and computation that fragments, reconstitutes, and arranges data in a way that shapes one possible meaning, as though the data can be reduced to an essentializing image? Instead, how might retheorizing the canon of arrangement for social media data collection, analysis, and visualization embrace rhetorical and feminist notions of pluralism in the way we see and understand data?
	
## Background on A Study of Anti-Gentrification Rhetoric on Twitter

To collect public Twitter data, I used an open-source social media harvesting tool, Social Feed Manager, developed by George Washington University Libraries and the Scholarly Technology Group, designed for use by scholars and archivists to collect and preserve social media datasets. Social Feed Manager has been used in other academic projects like Documenting the Now, which originally began in efforts to collect and archive tweets related to the Ferguson police shooting of Michael Brown and has since expanded to become a broader resource for social media collection. Although the tool interacts with several social media platforms, Doc Now notes that Twitter specifically “has emerged as one of the most important tools used in social activism to build support, share information and remain engaged with issues (Doc Now, White Paper, para 1). Social Feed Manager works by interacting with Twitter’s public Application Programming Interface (API) to collect tweets by user, keywords, hashtags or locations in real time following the guidelines of the API. 

Twitter’s API has several access levels, the most robust of which involve paying a use or subscription fee. By using the free access level, researchers can collect a sample of tweets in real time, or up to seven days in the past. Because of this time constraint, researchers have to begin collecting either as an event has already begun to unfold, or they have to choose a topic or phenomena that they expect will have ongoing interest and activity. When I set up SFM in February 2016, it wasn’t in response to a specific event or existing hashtag campaign, but more from the desire to understand how the conversation about gentrification developed on Twitter  over a sustained period of time, both locally and globally. [Flashback link] Once SFM is installed, and Twitter grants the researcher an access token, SFM will continue to collect according to Twitter’s API restrictions, which means it can send up to fifteen requests for data every fifteen minutes per access token. Because SFM is ongoing, it allows for collection in realtime and over an extended period of time, in my case two years; however, historical data that goes back more than seven days isn’t available without a fee. Although this is a significant constraint that largely prevents unfunded researchers from collecting Twitter data around an event or time period that has passed, as William Wolff (****) points out, social media APIs like Twitter’s does allow for an in situ study of rhetoric. 

Although commonly refers to something in a fixed, original place and time, in situ more accurately examines rhetoric “as it happens” (Endres, D., Hess, A., Senda-Cook, S., & Middleton, M. K., 2016, p. 516). Endres et al (2016) use the concept of in situ to describe a a critical and participatory methodology that “provides a means to account for the rhetoric of the everyday, to locate rhetoric in relationship to broader cultural discourses, and to open space for critics to analyze, participate with, and contribute to an emancipatory form of critique” (xiv). The authors argue that this participatory approach has deep roots in rhetorical criticism wherein a researcher’s particular perspective and relationship to the political and social issues at hand are explicitly involved in the resulting critical product and meaning made. Endres et al. observe that rhetoric is currently undergoing a participatory turn, which they emphasize relinquishes objectivity and even embraces an awareness of our influence on our research and knowledge product. In this perspective, research is inventive, rather than scientific. Endres et al also emphasize that “critical approaches to fieldwork highlight the value of using it to access those everyday rhetorics that would otherwise go unnoticed, undocumented, and unexamined” (517). Although they don’t apply in situ rhetorical fieldwork to social media data collection, Yarimar Bonilla and Jonathan Rossa (2015) “examine the possibilities, the stakes, and the necessity of taking these forms of activism seriously while remaining attentive to the limits and possible pitfalls of engaging in what we describe as ‘hashtag ethnography’” (5). Although Twitter data analysis, even when conducted with participatory and critical frameworks will continue to present logistical and ethical challenges, Twitter data analysis does allow from the study of “rhetoric as it happens,” and a means to document and examine everyday rhetorics that might not surface in other digital or physical contexts.
  
## Arranging Twitter Data

Using SFM to collect data for two years results in many compressed JSON files that contain the tweets and associated metadata like Tweet ID, Tweet URL, Created At, User Screen Name, Location, Text, Tweet Type, Coordinates, Hashtags, Media, etc. and some relational metadata like In Reply To, Favorite Count, Follower Count, etc. In this way, Twitter is already playing a part in arranging what can be accessed by providing user-produced data generated through the specific fields and options that Twitter makes available. Users have some agency in what they provide Twitter. For instance, Twitter doesn’t require users to provide real names or the true locations of where they life, so as a result the data may not accurately match up with “real” people or locations. In addition, not every field has to be populated and so not all available data types are present for every unique Twitter User or ID. For instance, various Twitter-based studies have found that only a small percentage of users geolocate their tweets, so “coordinates” is often, though not always, empty. 
Because gentrification is my topic, I’m especially interested in information related to place, but to locate usable data I had to use other methods to research place information. One way is to rely on the user’s location, a self-identified field that is part of a user’s Twitter profile; however, as previously mentioned, users don’t always include accurate location information, nor do they always tweet from their home locations. Although when users are tweeting about gentrification, it might be more reliable to assume that they’re tweeting from their home location, but certainly this won’t always be the case. The JSON data is not very readable, so I subsequently transformed those JSON files into a database structure to process with other analytical software programs. [Insert image of JSON file]

Although many rhetoric and writing studies examinations of social movements on Twitter focus, understandably, on hashtag collections, at the time when I began collecting I wasn’t aware of any major hashtag campaigns related to gentrification. Because I was interested in conducting more an exploratory study rather than focusing on a particular hashtag or particular groups, I decided to collect using the keyword seed “gentrification.” Initially, I wanted to understand how people were communicating about gentrification on Twitter, and what kinds of visual media they might share and for what purposes. This results of this keyword search would include any tweets that used “gentrification” as a hashtag, username, or word within the tweet. I collected from February 2016 until through the end of February 2018, allowing SFM to run for two full calendar years. This choice was influenced by personal experiences with urban change and reading news pieces, listening to everyday conversation, and observing plot lines in television and film. From my perspective, concerns about gentrification seemed to not only remain a salient topic over wide swaths of the public and media spheres but to be increasing in frequency as news sources and research organizations predicted continued urban growth (****). I also thought that the gentrification discussion might be relatively small on Twitter, a disparate simmer unlike the flurry of activity around a viral hashtag. My keyword search term “gentrification” would also limit my results since character-limited tweets would be encumbered by the lengthy and academic word. By collecting for two years, I hoped to amass a large dataset that would lend itself to comparative and individual case studies as well as for trend analysis across the corpora as a whole. Additionally, I chose to collect globally rather than focusing on a narrow location because recent studies in gentrification point to the need for more global data and perspectives on gentrification (****).

After a year, I had collected over 600,000 tweets, and after two years I had almost tripled that number, resulting in a final dataset of 1,914,243. To understand what this large dataset contained, I first used computational methods to glean a thematic overview of the dataset as a whole and analyze viral trends.
