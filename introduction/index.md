## Introduction

In recent years, rhetoric and writing studies scholars have started to work with big data and the technologies used to collect, process, and visualize a vast array of social phenomena. One such project is Laurie Gries’ (2016) Kairos publication, which analyzes different forms of data, including social media, to track the ongoing circulation and transformation of the Obama Hope image, largely through data visualization tools. In another Kairos piece, William I. Wolff (2015) describes his methodology for collecting and examining a sizable corpus of tweets around a Bruce Springsteen concert as a means by which to characterize Twitter-based fan writing practices. Jason Palmeri and Ben McCorkle (2017) analyze 100 years of English Journal through coding schemes and data visualization methods to historicize the disciplinary development of writing studies’ relationship to technology. The authors of each publication thoughtfully reflect on the constraints and limitations of their studies, particularly highlighting the ways in which their choices in data collection, processing, and visualization have shaped their findings. 

Studies like these acknowledge the influence of “the interplay of material infrastructures, users and texts,” and, by doing so, begin to trouble the objective and scientific valence often ascribed to data analysis and visualization, especially when attached to “Big Data” (Leurs, 2017, p. 137). And yet, as rhetoric and writing studies scholars become more adept at working with data and visualization, including gaining fluency with the tools available for this kind of research, scholarly critique of these technologies often becomes obscured by the clean, and seemingly objective, quantitative results from their now “black boxed” form. In the push for more big data projects, it is increasingly difficult and important for digital rhetoric and writing studies scholars to contribute methodological perspectives that illuminate the unseen and provide new possibilities for rhetorically engaging technologies at the level of infrastructure. Approaching these big data projects from a rhetorical and feminist methodological approach, I argue, can deepen data viz’s critical possibilities and conclusions by expanding their possibilities rather than narrowing data analysis conclusions to grasp toward a truth value (boyd & Crawford, 2012).

In this webtext, I will share the feminist rhetorical methodology of social media data and visualization I’ve begun to develop over the past two years while researching a large dataset of tweets containing the keyword “gentrification.” My purpose for using Twitter data in this project is threefold. Firstly, like Laurie Gries’ “Tracking Obama Hope” project, I’m interested in how writing and visual rhetoric circulates to activate publics and ignite collective actions, particularly with a focus on how that circulating visuality impacts the changing shape and socio-cultural make-up of urban spaces and their communities. Twitter, which has proven to be a communication space for marginalized populations to voice dissent and to collectively take action against dominant power structures (Jules, Summers, & Mitchell, 2018, White Paper), affords the ability to track often overlooked visual rhetoric. Additionally, Twitter provides real-time, multi-positional data to examine the process of as it happens, which will form the foundation of my theory of rhetorical circulation in-situ. Secondly, Twitter is an under-researched communication platform that provides an excellent medium to explore closely the effect of social media technologies on communication practices. As Leigh Gruwell (2018) observes, rhetoric and writing studies have “embraced social media as both an object of study as well as a methodological tool,” and yet the authors point out that we have not gone far enough to consider how these platforms shape our research (para. 2). In part to answer calls like Gruwell’s, this study engages with Twitter’s affordances as an entry point into a wider ecology of emergent social media platforms, physical environments, and bodies that leave traces we can follow to better understand the consequences of their ecological relations. Exploration of these interacting entities informs our understanding of activism in the digital age and the way in which networked visuality and communication technologies complicate our understanding of material processes like gentrification, collective activities like activism, and exploration of “ecological relationality as participating in rhetorical practices and their theorization” (Rickert, 2013, p. 3).  

Lastly, my large Twitter dataset affords an opportunity to analyze the rhetorical process of creating big data visualizations. Because of the enormous size of this collection, I wouldn’t be able sift through, count, or qualitatively explore this dataset without the technological tools of visualization, or “the reduction and spatial representation of datasets in such a way as to make them more intelligible than in their pre‐visualization, tabular format” (Hepworth, 2017, p. 8). This webtext won’t simply focus on the visualizations I’ve generated, however, but delve into the infrastructural affordances of this process and how a feminist rhetorical perspective might work with and against the possibilities of these technologies. Instead of reifying the scientific veneer of data science, I strive to contribute to the growing body of critical scholarship that offers rhetorical and generative alternatives to data analysis and visualization methods that privilege quantitative reasoning and focus on revealing “newly visible patterns.” In my case, quantification and pattern finding have been a beginning point for formulating subsequent research directions that use both analytical and inventive approaches to study large datasets.

Indeed, at the core of my methodological argument is the belief that data analysis and visualization are enhanced and complicated by adopting a feminist rhetorical methodology that values qualitative data, multiplicity, and narrative. In using feminist theories, I’m connecting to diverse and varied critical perspectives. Incorporating feminist theories from digital humanities and critical media studies “encompasses a range of ideas about how identity is constructed, how power is assigned, and how knowledge is generated, as well as how a range of intersectional forces such as race, class, and ability, combine to influence the experience of being in the world” (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2016, para. 1). This work is also an answer to Johanna Drucker’s (2017) call “to attend to how visualizations do their work if we are to fully understand the work that they do” (p. 913). Such a methodology provides for greater understanding of the way in which such data is shaped and adds nuance to the way in which we work with large datasets to make knowledge and share insight gained through data analysis and visualization. Finding a feminist perspective through data, as I’ll show, results in a methodology that is not just analytical and critical but also generative and inventive.
